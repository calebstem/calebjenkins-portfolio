        <h1>About</h1>
<p>Caleb Jenkins is a graphic designer based in Chattanooga. His work examines cultural mythologies and their material consequences, tracing how narratives about place, progress, and identity shape social and spatial realities. Working across publication design, photography, video, and motion graphics, he transforms research into visual arguments that interrogate the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and where we&#39;re going.</p>
