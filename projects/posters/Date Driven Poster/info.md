Through tallying my daily usage of Zyn pouches, I present the data in a clear, visual format.

I began using nicotine when I was 14. For almost 10 years I have been addicted. What fuels my addiction is no longer pleasure or social pressures. Instead, there is a raw necessity to accomplish what is required of me, be it work or school.  I may have started with Juul, then Camel Blues, but for me, Zyn is the source with the least side effects. There is a stigma attached to being so dependent on a substance. Through the act of visualizing and presenting my consumption, I challenge the shame of addiction. An irony reveals itself, as the necessity of nicotine fuels the project on my said need. These nicotine pouches may be discreet, but their consequences are visible.
