Utilizing found line art illustrations and archival New York Times classified ads, a new narrative is formed.

If America is a nation of immigrants, California is the teleological amplification of such aptitude.
The foundational mythos of white America begins with the consecration of Plymouth rock. If the origin of America is tied to the Plymouth colony’s discovery of a granite stone, the story of California lays at Sutter's Mill with the discovery of golden flakes. 
To this day, individuals continue moving to America seeking a better life. As such, the search for the California dream continues to prosper. The gold rush never ended but was instead transmuted from the material to the metaphorical, from the prospector to the movie star. 
Remember that (almost) nothing is guaranteed, no promises must be kept: from the original pioneers dying before their destination to the likes of Sharon Tate and River Phoenix, there will always be a price to pay.
