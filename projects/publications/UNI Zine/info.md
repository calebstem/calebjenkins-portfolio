A publication adapting Hito Steyerl's essay "A Thing Like You and Me," which explores the shift from subject to object in contemporary image culture. The design uses a modular grid system to mirror Steyerl's argument about participation in images as material things rather than representations: treating text and image as equally weighted objects on the page.
